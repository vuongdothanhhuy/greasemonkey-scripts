{"name":"Greasemonkey Scripts","tagline":"My Greasemonkey scripts collection","body":"### What is this?\r\n\r\nThis is my personal collection of greasemonkey scripts. I initially developed them for my own personal use.\r\n\r\n### How to use?\r\n\r\nMost, if not all, of these scripts are also hosted at https://openuserjs.org/users/vuongdothanhhuy/scripts, so you can visit it, choose and install the script you like, with one click. Of course you will need to have Greasemonkey plugin (if you use Firefox), or Tampermonkey extension (if you use Chrome/Chromium) installed first.\r\n\r\n### Questions? Comments? Suggestions?\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to fork and make any pull request if you have found a bug, or a better way to do a thing, or a nice feature to add.","google":"UA-55891336-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
